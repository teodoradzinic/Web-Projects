            <p class="definition"><dfn>Chocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available
                    as a
                    liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods.</dfn>
                <strong>Cacao</strong> has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization
                (19th-11th century
                BCE),and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made
                chocolate
                beverages.

                    <p>The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the
                        flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted.
                        The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass,
                        unadulterated
                        chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate
                        liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids
                        and
                        cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and
                        cocoa
                        butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which
                        contains
                        more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of
                        the
                        chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids,
                        cocoa
                        butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar.
                        Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk.
                        White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.</p>

                        Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many
                        foodstuffs
                        involving chocolate exist, particularly <em>desserts</em>, including <strong>cakes, pudding,
                            mousse, chocolate
                            brownies</strong>, and <strong>chocolate chip cookies</strong>. Many candies are filled
                        with
                        or coated with sweetened
                        chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in
                        chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as
                        eggs,
                        hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter,
                        Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as
                        chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.
                        Although cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly CÃ´te
                        d'Ivoire
                        and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60%
                        of
                        the world cocoa supply. <cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate</cite>

            <h2 class="history-heading">History</h2>
            <p>Chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found
                at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate's preparation
                by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.6 On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya
                archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.The
                residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not
                simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of
                fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.</p>

                    Several types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called
                    "baking
                    chocolate", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the
                    chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.

                    <dd>Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the
                        UK
                        and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the

                        the European Union, the minimum is 25%</dd>

                        Drug
                        Administration calls this "sweet chocolate", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate
